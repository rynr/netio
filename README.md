netio
=====

NETIO is a series of smart sockets nd PDU (Power Distribution Unit) by
[Koukaam](http://www.koukaam.se/kkm/index.php).

This library gives you a Java-Interface to control them.

Include
-------

To use this library (in the current state), you have to build it yourself. Once
the next release is done, you can use it via maven, gradle, â€¦.

The next release includes support for java 9 modules. You require
`org.rjung.util.netio`.

Current State
-------------

This library is in a non stable state at the moment. The library on maven
central can be used and uses a socket connection. The current main branch has
changed to use a `http` connection, but it's not done yet.

Example
-------

```java
NetworkSwitch networkSwitch = NetworkSwitch.builder("switch.host.name", 2345)
        .username("admin").password("secret").build();
// Switch all 4 units off (1 on, 0 off, i reset, u no-change)
networkSwitch.set(1, Switch.ON);
```
